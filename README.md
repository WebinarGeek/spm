# spm

The lightweight Screen Procfile Manager

![test](./spm.svg)

Using spm you can start/stop connect/kill Procfile defined services easily.
Either one by one or in bulk by using single characters or full argument names.
For example, consider a Procfile like this:

```
caddy: caddy run
rails: bundle exec rails s
nginx: nginx
```

You can then run `spm s` or `spm start` to start all of these in separate screens.
After that you can run a series of other subcommands to manage them.
Most commands can either run for all Procfile-defined services or by service name.
You can for example restart rails with `spm r rails` or restart them all with `spm r`.

# Install

The default pip-method:

```bash
pip install --user -I git+https://github.com/WebinarGeek/spm
```

The above can also be used to upgrade, though you might need to use `pip3` instead.
Or alternatively, the "I don't want to install pip"-method:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebinarGeek/spm/master/spm.py -o ~/.local/bin/spm
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/spm
```

And then make sure that `~/.local/bin` is actually in your `$PATH`.
